Allows you to remove specific content of your posts from RSS feeds and replace it with any customizable message. Useful for removing embedded videos or images which don't display properly in RSS readers.

== Description ==

RSSless is a WordPress plugin which allows you to hide specific content in your posts from RSS readers. This is helpful for bloggers who embed videos, images, or other content which doesn't display or embed correctly in RSS readers. Rather then having RSS readers get blank content, you can simply replace it with customizable message, such as "Please view the original article to watch this video."

RSSless uses WordPress' built in short code API. Simply surround the content you want to hide from RSS readers with the [rssless] [/rssless] short code tags

First Installation:

1. Download rssless.zip and unzip it.
2. Upload the plugin folder to wp-content/plugins/ and activate from the Plugin administrative menu.
3. Navigate to the plugins Options Menu (Settings > RSSless) and set the default replacement message.
